# liri-node-app
Twitter, Spotify, and OMDB request project

This application will take several commands and reference different nodes/APIs based on the input.

For Twitter, simply enter "node liri.js my-tweets" to receive a list of the 20 most recent tweets on my timeline (all beer).

For Spotify, simply enter "node liri.js spotify-this-song ["Song Title"]" to receive the artist, track name, preview URL, and album.

For OMDB, simply enter "node liri.js movie-this ["Movie-Title"]" to receive the title, year, IMDB and RT ratings, country, language, plot, and actors.

And last but not least, by typing "node liri.js do-what-it-says" I will reference a command in the random.txt file.  In my example it will spotify the song "I Want it That Way" (classic jam).
